async_drv
=========
I couldn't find an up-to-date full working tutorial on how to
build linked-in drivers sync and async so here it is!.

In the branch linked-in-driver-sync, you will find a full working
sync driver, as many tutorials around the Internet. 
But this one compiles and works for even R15 and is a full
working example (storing PIDs etc).

In the default branch, you can find the async version.

Enjoy
